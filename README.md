# Election Analysis with Python

## Overview of Election Audit
In this project, an audit of a recent local congressional eletion will be generated using a Python script. The script needs to produce the following information: 
- Total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- Total number of votes each candidate received
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout

## Election-Audit Results
The outcomes of the election are as follows:
- The total votes that were casted in this congressional election were 369,711.

- The number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precint are presented below:
    - Jefferson had 38,855 votes which comprised 10.5% of the total votes. 
    - Denver had 306,055 votes which comprised 82.8% of the total votes.
    - Arapahoe had 24,801 votes which comprised 6.7% of the total votes.

- The county with the largest voter turnout was:
    - Denver which had 306,055 votes for an equivalent of 82.8% of the total votes.

- The number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received are presented below:
    - Charles Casper Stockham garnered 85,213 votes, which is 23.0% of the total votes.
    - Diana DeGette garnered 272,892 votes which is 73.8% of the total votes
    - Raymon Anthony Doane garnered 11,606 votes which is 3.1% of the total votes.

## Election-Audit Summary

Election is a re-occuring phenomena and not one a one time event. In addition, depending on the type of election, the analysis can increase in complexity as the data gets larger. Given these factors, the script that was used to analyze the Colorado election is able to accommodate this. For instance, the script is flexible enough to accommodate additional data to complete the audit. Specifically, for this project, additional data about county was requested to be analyzed. Even though information about county was not included in the original script for the election analysis, the script was flexible enough to acquire this information. In addition, generating this was not complicated as it was built on the same concept of the original script. Therefore, using this script for any election will definitely not cause issues. Furthermore, the script written is highly efficient and well-structured. For any election anaylsis, efficiency is highly desirable. The script will certainly perform well especially for larger scale elections such as federal election. For example, the script is able to generate the election results and at the same time write this result on a separate file to visualize the results better. By using this script for any election, one can acquire the flexibility with regards to the information generated from the analysis and achieve efficiency at the same time.
